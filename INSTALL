You'll need the following applications and libraries to build and run Abraca:

    o xmms2 (obviously)
    o Gtk2
    o libglade
    o libnotify (optional)
    o python (the build system depends on this)

Execute the following commands to compile and install Abraca:

    `./waf configure && ./waf && ./waf install'
